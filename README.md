## Notebook 
- [:file_folder: Jupyter notebook with brazilian air network investigation](./Project_U2P1.ipynb)

## Main Findings
- The Brazilian network exhibits a significant level of connectivity.
- The Southeast region demonstrates the highest degree of interconnectivity, while the Northeast region exhibits the lowest.
- Only five airports remain unconnected to the national network.
- The assortativity is low, indicating a tendency for regions to connect with one another rather than within themselves.
